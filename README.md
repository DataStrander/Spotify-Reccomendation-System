# Spotify-Reccomendation-System
Machine Learning Model to suggest to my colleagues new songs according to their music taste and any playlist as benchmark

![Tests](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/workflows/Tests/badge.svg?branch=master) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/spotipy/badge/?version=latest)](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## Prologue 

We will work with Jupytext to convert the script into a Jupyter readable file and with the Spotipy library to get access to the Spotify API through Python Library
.\through Anaconda Prompt
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge jupytext
conda install -c conda-forge spotipy
```

.\ through the Terminal
```bash
pip install jupytext
pip install spotipy
```

### Spotify API Authentification

Spotify offers the chance to develope Apps to be used according to the code you deliver on their [Developers Platform](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/). You just need to sign in with your normal account and then you can visualize all the credentials you need to connect your or someone's playlist and explore that Dataframe.

### Data Source Creation

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### BPM

## Reccomendation Algorythm
- `$HOME/.local/bin` for Unix

### Feature Engineering

```python
bpm = 140
```
